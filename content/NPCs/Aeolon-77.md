## Overview
Magos Aeolon-77 is the chief Tech-Priest aboard the [[Sword of Damocles]]. Renowned for his mastery of voidship systems and archaeotech, Aeolon-77 ensures the cruiser operates at peak efficiency while balancing the often conflicting demands of the Inquisition and the Adeptus Mechanicus.

## Appearance
- Wrapped in crimson robes bearing the insignia of the Omnissiah, Aeolon-77 is an imposing figure.
- His body is heavily augmented, featuring mechadendrites, servo-limbs, and glowing optical augmetics.
- A servo-arm on his back projects data-scrolls, and his cogitator implants hum faintly when in operation.
- Three servo-skulls orbit Aeolon-77, acting as assistants and surveillance drones.
